          Due to the differences in color monitors/screens and lighting used
          during photoshoots, the exact color or texture of the final item may
          slightly vary from what is seen on the screen, therefore products
          cannot be exchanged for this reason. We will only exchange any
          product(s), if the product(s) received has any kind of manufacturing
          defect.
